** Digital Craftsman (Developer/Public Health/Health Informatics) ** 


As a young professional bursting with energy and optimism, I'm eagerly looking
ahead to the exciting journey that lies before me. With a background in Public Health Policy 
and a genuine love for computer science and AI, I'm passionate about making healthcare 
more accessible, especially for those who need it most in low-income and marginalized 
communities. I'm driven by a deep-seated belief in the power of technology to tackle 
societal challenges, and I'm always on the lookout for new ways to learn and grow in the 
fields of computer science, healthcare, and AI. My goal is to come up with innovative 
solutions that not only improve healthcare but also empower people from all walks of life 
to live healthier, happier lives. As I step into this next chapter of my journey, I'm excited 
about the opportunity to make a real difference in the world by combining my interests and
skills. Let's embark on this adventure together and see where it takes us!
