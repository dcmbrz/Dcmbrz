** Digital Craftsman (Developer/Public Health/Health Informatics) ** 


As a young professional bursting with energy and optimism, I'm eagerly looking<br/>
ahead to the exciting journey that lies before me. With a background in Public Health Policy<br/>
and a genuine love for computer science and AI, I'm passionate about making healthcare <br/>
more accessible, especially for those who need it most in low-income and marginalized <br/>
communities. I'm driven by a deep-seated belief in the power of technology to tackle <br/>
societal challenges, and I'm always on the lookout for new ways to learn and grow in the <br/>
fields of computer science, healthcare, and AI. My goal is to come up with innovative <br/>
solutions that not only improve healthcare but also empower people from all walks of life <br/>
to live healthier, happier lives. As I step into this next chapter of my journey, I'm excited <br/>
about the opportunity to make a real difference in the world by combining my interests and<br/>
skills. Let's embark on this adventure together and see where it takes us!<br/>
